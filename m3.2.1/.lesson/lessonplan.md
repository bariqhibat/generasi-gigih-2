## Classroom Structure

Starting in Module 03 onwards, we are changing our classroom structure a little bit. Previously, we rely heavily on students' having finished their homework before the classroom session. Going forward, we are going to have two different activities: a hands-on exercise and a homework. Students are expected to have tried the hands-on exercise before the classroom session starts. In the classroom session, instructors are expected to do a  walkthrough of the hands-on exercise. This is to help students who have difficulty in trying the hands-on experience on their own. Aftewards, students are expected to do the homework after the classroom session is over and submit the homework at 17:00 the next day.

We will structure our classroom as follows:

- 17.00 - 17.10: Opening
- 17.10 - 17.30: Homework Showcase
- 17.30 - 18.00: Material and Review Exercise
- 18.00 - 18.30: Break
- 18.30 - 19.15: Hands-On Exercise
- 19.15 - 19.30: Discussion
- 19.30 - 20.00: Closing

Please note that now Homework Showcase is for homework from the previous classroom session. It means, for Wednesday classroom session, we showcase homework from Monday. As for this Monday, we only showcase their hands-on experience progress.
