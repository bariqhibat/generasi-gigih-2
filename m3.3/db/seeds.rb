# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# Customer.create(name: "Bariq")
# Customer.create(name: "Nurlis")
# Order.create(order_date: "01/01/2022", customer_id: 1)
# Order.create(order_date: "02/01/2022", customer_id: 1)
# Order.create(order_date: "03/01/2022", customer_id: 1)
# Order.create(order_date: "04/01/2022", customer_id: 1)
